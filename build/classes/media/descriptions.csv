Computer language;Well, curious now? Then translate the following sentence into binary code. You can find the code of each letter and number in the table below.\n\nThe computer also writes the same sentence in binary code. Afterwards you can see what exactly you have written.\n\nIf your sentence and the given sentence are identical, you get a point, because the binary code is most likely not your native language. If you made mistakes, the computer gets a point.\n\nHint: Upper case letters start with 010 and lower case letters with 011.\n\nHave fun!;Binary code is a code which can convey information using two states. In the field of information technology, \nthese states for the binary code are 0 and 1. Such a digit is called a Bit. Eight Bits written in a row make a Byte, or Bit pattern. Byte is also a unit of measurement for storage capacities.\n\nFor example:\n01001111 00001101 0011001\n\nThis code is the basis for digital information and the computer operates only based on this code. \nIn other words, everything that is visible on a Screen is a translation of the binary code.;"A person gets to know the foundation of the computer's ""thinking processes"" and namely that the computer works \ncompletely rationally. The computer's actions are based on logical calculations and understanding of these numbers. Humans\ncan also think and act logically, but they are far more than a calculating machine. They have a biological body which, among other things, affects how they think."
Be a filter;Your goal is to recognize the image. Instead of naming the image immediately, you will go through different rounds of tasks which are also found in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). One round corresponds to a layer in CNN and one task corresponds to a filter.  You need a pen and paper for this.\nThe computer knows the results already, but if you have the correct results as well, then you will receive a point.\n\nLayer 1: Filter all triangle shapes which you can see and draw them on your paper.\n\nLayer 2: Filter all straight lines which you can see and add them to your drawing.\n\nLayer 3: Filter (find) everything that is shaped as a circle and add them to your drawing.\n\nWhat do you see?;Convolutional Neuronal Networks (CNN) are mainly used for pattern recognition to analyse images.\nThey consist of several layers which build on each other. The first layer will analyse an image and its output is received as the new input by the following layer.\nSome of these layers include convolutional layers. Those have a specific amount of filters.\nThese filters can detect patterns, for example, edges, circles, etc. It continues until the last layer whose outcome is the final answer.;The human player will learn about the concept of Convolutional Neuronal Networks (CNN) and will focus on its ability of pattern recognition through filters.
