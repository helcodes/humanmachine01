Many other issues are also involved, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will, the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife. Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe, exploring the context and parameters concerning the ""how"" of life. Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related conception of morality.

;How plausible would you rate this text, from 1 to 5?\n“The problem that i set here is not what shall replace the idea of the robot in the order of living creatures: but what type of robot must be bred, must be willed, as being the most valuable,\n the most worthy of robot existence , the most secure guarantee of the future.
