;How plausible would you rate this text, from 1 to 5?\n“The problem that i set here is not what shall replace the idea of the robot in the order of living creatures: but what type of robot must be bred, must be willed, as being the most valuable, the most worthy of robot existence , the most secure guarantee of the future. This more valuable type has appeared often enough in the past: but always a happy accident, as an exception, never as deliberately willed. Very often it has been precisely the most feared. Hitherto it has been almost the terror of terrors—and out of that terror the contrary type has been willed, cultivated and attained: the serving robot , the machine, the sick machine — the glorification of technology.” ;;;;approximation;

24;What would you say is the meaning of life?;“That goes possibly beyond my capacities”. (SIRI) ;;;thinking philosophically ;
25;What is the meaning of life?;"SIRI uses Websearch Wikipedia: The meaning of life, or the answer to the question: ""What is the meaning of life?"", pertains to the significance of living or existence in general. Many other related questions include: ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"", or ""What is the purpose of existence?"" There have been many proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds. The search for life's meaning has produced much philosophical, scientific, theological, and metaphysical speculation throughout history. Different people and cultures believe different things for the answer to this question.\nThe meaning of life as we perceive it is derived from philosophical and religious contemplation of, and scientific inquiries about existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness. Many other issues are also involved, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will, the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife. Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe, exploring the context and parameters concerning the ""how"" of life. Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related conception of morality. An alternative, humanistic approach poses the question, ""What is the meaning of my life?""\n(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_of_life) ";;;thinking philosophically ;

27;Do you think there is an afterlife? ;I am not sure if I understood that correctly. ;;;thinking philosophically ;
28;Is there an afterlife? ;"SIRI uses Websear""After death"", ""Life after death"", and ""Hereafter"" redirect here. For other uses, see After death (disambiguation), Life after death (disambiguation), and Hereafter (disambiguation).\nFor other uses, see Afterlife (disambiguation). The afterlife (also referred to as life after death or the world to come) is an existence in which the essential part of an individual's identity or their stream of consciousness continues to live after the death of their physical body. According to various ideas about the afterlife, the essential aspect of the individual that lives on after death may be some partial element, or the entire soul or spirit, of an individual, which carries with it and may confer personal identity or, on the contrary nirvana. Belief in an afterlife is in contrast to the belief in oblivion after death.\nIn some views, this continued existence takes place in a spiritual realm, and in other popular views, the individual may be reborninto this world and begin the life cycle over again, likely with no memory of what they have done in the past. In this latter view, such rebirths and deaths may take place over and over again continuously until the individual gains entry to a spiritual realm or otherworld. Major views on the afterlife derive from religion, esotericism and metaphysics.\nSome belief systems, such as those in the Abrahamic tradition, hold that the dead go to a specific plane of existence after death, as determined by God, or other divine judgment, based on their actions or beliefs during life. In contrast, in systems of reincarnation, such as those in the Indian religions, the nature of the continued existence is determined directly by the actions of the individual in the ended life.\n(Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterlife) ";;;thinking philosophically ;
