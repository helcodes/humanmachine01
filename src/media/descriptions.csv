Computer language;Well, curious now? Then translate the following sentence into binary code. You can find the code of each letter and number in the table below.\n\nThe computer also writes the same sentence in binary code. Afterwards you can see what exactly you have written.\n\nIf your sentence and the given sentence are identical, you get a point, because the binary code is most likely not your native language. If you made mistakes, the computer gets a point.\n\nHint: Upper case letters start with 010 and lower case letters with 011.\n\nHave fun!;Binary code is a code which can convey information using two states. In the field of information technology, \nthese states for the binary code are 0 and 1. Such a digit is called a Bit. Eight Bits written in a row make a Byte, or Bit pattern. Byte is also a unit of measurement for storage capacities.\n\nFor example:\n01001111 00001101 0011001\n\nThis code is the basis for digital information and the computer operates only based on this code. \nIn other words, everything that is visible on a Screen is a translation of the binary code.;"A person gets to know the foundation of the computer's ""thinking processes"" and namely that the computer works \ncompletely rationally. The computer's actions are based on logical calculations and understanding of these numbers. Humans\ncan also think and act logically, but they are far more than a calculating machine. They have a biological body which, among other things, affects how they think."
Be a filter ;Your goal is to recognize the image. Instead of naming the image immediately, you will go through different rounds of tasks which are also found in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). One round corresponds to a layer in CNN and one task corresponds to a filter. You need a pen and paper for this.\nThe computer knows the results already, but if you have the correct results as well, then you will receive a point.\n\nLayer 1: Filter all triangle shapes which you can see and draw them on your paper.\n\nLayer 2: Filter all straight lines which you can see and add them to your drawing.\n\nLayer 3: Filter (find) everything that is shaped as a circle and add them to your drawing.\n\nWhat do you see?;Convolutional Neuronal Networks (CNN) are mainly used for pattern recognition to analyse images.\nThey consist of several layers which build on each other. The first layer will analyse an image and its output is received as the new input by the following layer.\nSome of these layers include convolutional layers. Those have a specific amount of filters.\nThese filters can detect patterns, for example, edges, circles, etc. It continues until the last layer whose outcome is the final answer.;The human player will learn about the concept of Convolutional Neuronal Networks (CNN) and will focus on its ability of pattern recognition through filters.
mathematics/calculus;Please solve the following equations. ;These question were answered by the means of a traditional pocket calculator with the ability to solve functions such as the Texas Instruments Pocket Calculator “TI-84 Plus CE-T”. \n\nNowadays, it is not possible to imagine a smartphone without an integrated calculator or calculus lessons in school without students using calculators. But it has not been always possible to use a calculator for solving mathematical questions. \nThe first calculators, which were mainframe computers, were developed at the beginning of the age of computers in the 1940s and 1950s. They were as big as a whole room and were dependent on technologies like transistors or vacuum tubes. \nBefore, humans could only use pen and paper or older counting devices like an abacus for instance, besides their brain power in order to solve calculations or equations. \nOnly in 1957, the calculator Model 14-A of the Casio Computer Company was developed, which was the first full electronic compact calculator. \nIt was, however, still so big that it had to be incorporated into a table. It was only until the end of the 1970s that calculators had become, due to constant development of computers and microprocessors, cheaper and smaller so that they were affordable and could be carried in one´s own pocket. \n\n Most pocket calculators are based on integrated circuits, more commonly known as chips. Integrated circuits contain transistors and by the means of electricity calculations can be done. \nTransistors are semiconductor components which can function as latches, regulators or amplifiers or can be also used as an electronic resistance. In the same way as all other electronic devices, pocket calculators process information in binary form. \nThe integrated circuit of the calculator translates numbers on basis of the binary system into binary character strings with 0 and 1. This is in contrary to how humans are used to think numbers - in the basis-ten-system where ten numbers function (0-9). \nThe integrated circuits of the pocket calculators then translate these 0 and 1 chains in order to turn the transistors with electricity both on and off, in order to do the desired calculations. \nDue to the fact that in the binary system there are only two options, 0 and 1, these options can be easily represented by activating and deactivating transistors - activating and deactivating are easy binary options,\n activated = 0 and deactivated = 1, or the other way around. After the calculations is finished, the answer in binary form will be converted back into the basis-10-system and will be represented on the calculation-screen.\n\n Besides the most fundamental calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, today´s scientific calculators can do highly complex mathematical calculations. \nIt is obvious that the capacities of these devices fundamentally excel human´s capacities of calculating. Highly complex calculations are done for example by so called supercomputers which have an especially fast computing power. \nFor instance, the supercomputer called “Juwels” from the german city Jülich has a computing power of 85 petaflops, which is the same as the ability to do 85 thousand trillion calculating operations per second. \nBy using such a supercomputer, complex scientific research questions can be answered - they are used for instance for the search of active substances against Covid-19, for optimizing wind-driven power stations or for answering questions from particle physics. \nThrough the development of these devices, humans can dive into new spheres in a variety of scientific areas in a way which would not have been possible without these devices. \n\n Sources: Deintaschenrechner.de.2020.”Wie funktioniert dein Taschenrechner”.

Furthermore, information is given on how calculators have been developing over time and effects connected to these developments. Also, it is explained how a pocket calculator functions. 
thinking philosophically ;Please answer the following questions. Please use a maximum of five sentences. ;The topics ethics and philosophy, to deal with ethical and philosophical questions, have been ever since a fundamental part of human existence and living. \nTo deal with philosophical and ethical questions like the ones covered in this section, becomes earlier or later a part of a human´s life. To these questions, there is no clear right or wrong answer. Answering them depends on the subjective perception of the subject which answers them. \nMoreover, for being able to answer such questions, one needs to have a consciousness as well as the ability to think independently. \n\n contrast to humans, there are no computers, algorithms or other sorts of programs or devices which have something like a consciousness or which are able to think independently and answer independently questions by referring to selfmade experiences for example. \nThey are dependent on what kind of informations humans have preprogrammed. \n\n The questions from this section were answered, as a representation of digital personal speech-driven assistents, by one of the most known and most popular of these - Apple´s personal speech-driven assistent Siri. \nAs the answers of Siri to the questions from this section show, Siri has only a very limited capacity in this context: it can a.) use preprogrammed phrases by humans such as “This lies outside my capacities” or b.) use websearch and therefore, also refer to publications made by humans. Still, using websearch does not mean simoultaneously that the results are fiting to the questions posed. \nHowever, Siri is not able to answer these questions by thinking indepently, as a human is able to do it. n\n Siri is the short form for Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface and it is an integrated, speech-driven personal assitent, usable by Apple users. \nIt was developed to make the interaction with one´s Apple device easier and find or do the things on one´s device, one wants to. One can ask it questions, for example: “how will the weather be the next days?” ask to show things: “please show me the results of the latest results of the Austrian national football team” or give it orders: “please call Miriam”. \nIt has access to every other integrated application on one´s Apple device such as E-Mail, contacts, messages, maps, safari, etc. and it can ask these applications to present data or search through databases. n\n Siri functions on the areas of artificial intelligence and processing thorugh natural language and it is composed of three components: \na conversation interface, the consiousness for the personal context and the delegation of services. \nThe conversation interface is necessary for that Siri can understand someone. The decoding of the significance of what one says is dependent on statistics and machine learning. The personal context-consciousness-system helps Siri to interprete correctly what the user wants to say and do by remembering keywords of the user, her/his habits or her/his general use of language. \nThe service-delegation-system is the ability to have access to all applications integrated in the Apple device. This is what enable Siri to operate on the device. n\n Source: Pocket-lint. 2020. “Was ist Siri und wie arbeitet Siri?”.
